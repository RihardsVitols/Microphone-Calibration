# mic_calibration_SC

The NAME Project is a collection of 3 3D models for bulding a 1st order ambisonic mic and a collection of SuperColider codes for mic calibration. 
The 3D models are almost completely parametric and are designed to be printed on a resin 3D printer. I used Formlabs 2. Mic consists out of 3 parts - body, electronics cover and mesh screen.
