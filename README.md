# mic_calibration_SC

The NAME Project is a collection of 3 3D models for bulding a 1st order ambisonic mic and a collection of SuperColider codes for mic calibration. 
The 3D models are almost completely parametric and are designed to be printed on a resin 3D printer. I used Formlabs 2. Mic consists out of 3 parts - body, electronics cover and mesh screen.


About building microphones
Successfully printing a microphone assembly is only the first step in a long and complicated process. This also includes finding and buying the required microphone capsules, assembling the electronics (requires precision skill with the soldering iron) and finally calibrating the multi-capsule microphone to get the best performance out of it (you will need at least a single driver sound source and a calibrated microphone).

The whole process is not easy and requires knowledge of acoustics and electronics, plus a healthy dose of patience and the ability to perform tasks with precision and care. This repository will eventually include more detailed instructions, electronic schematics, suggested and tested parts and software and procedures for calibrating and measuring the microphone, including models for test and calibration rigs.
